                    <p>
                        I am a creative coder and digital artist working with new technologies, having graduated from the Glasgow School of Art with a 2:1 in Interaction Design. As a student on this course, I actively worked from design-focused briefs that encourage experimentation and the exploration of innovative mediums with an emphasis on computation as part of the creative process. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My prior years as a gigging musician served as an inspiration for the Velo(city) project, with the aim to resolve both my musical and creative coding experience into a unified creative practice. I am constantly fascinated with the relationship between sound and visuals with the endeavour to apply this to the areas of music/stage design, interactive installations, and therapeutic devices.
